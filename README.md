A movielover application.

## Getting Started

This project is a basic app that shows new and highlighted movies, using themoviedb API.
It was created as a challenge for a hiring process, and consists of a scrollable home page, that shows the top movies, and a movie details screen.

Main characteristics are state management using Providers, well designed architecture, using repository controller service, dynamic listview building and image caching.
